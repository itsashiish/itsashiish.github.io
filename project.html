                            The design problem and the target audience needs to be defined. A precise understanding of the problem and its constraints allows more exact solutions to be developed. This stage determines what is necessary for the project to be successful. The research stage reviews information such as the history of the design problem, end-user research and opinion-led interviews, and identifies potential obstacles.<br><br>In<b> Empathize</b>, you should gain an empathetic understanding of the problem you’re trying to solve, typically through user research. Empathy is crucial to a human-centered design process such as design thinking because it allows you to set aside your own assumptions about the world and gain real insight into users and their needs. <br><br><b>Define</b> is where it’s time to accumulate the information gathered during the Empathize stage. You then analyze your observations and synthesize them to define the core problems you and your team have identified. These definitions are called problem statements. You can create personas to help keep your efforts human-centered before proceeding to ideation.<br><br><b>Ideate</b> is when you’re ready to generate ideas. The solid background of knowledge from the first two phases means you can start to “think outside the box”, look for alternative ways to view the problem and identify innovative solutions to the problem statement you’ve created. Brainstorming is particularly useful here<br><br><b>Prototyping</b> sees the resolve or working-up of these ideas, which are presented for user-group and stakeholder review, prior to being presented to the client. This is an experimental phase. The aim is to identify the best possible solution for each problem found.<br><br>In<b> Testing</b>, Put your prototype in front of real customers and verify that it achieves your goals. Has the users’ perspective during onboarding improved? Does the new landing page increase time or money spent on your site? As you are executing your vision, continue to test along the way. <br><br>

                              <b>Confusing Menu</b> - When hungry customers want to order online, they don’t want to spend their time navigating a complicated menu that doesn’t allow them to easily modify or add to their food selection. If customers try to order online and find that the menu is confusing or complicated, they will more than likely click away from the site and abandon their cart, if they were able to put anything inside. If you find in your analytics that there is a larger number of people visiting your online ordering page and the numbers exceed the numbers of people who are, in fact, ordering online, checking your online ordering process might point toward a complicated menu and ordering system.<br><br><b>Timeliness</b> - Once an order has been placed online, it needs to pass through several landing spots. The order needs to get to the restaurant, into the kitchen, and into the point-of-sale program. Once that’s been done, the food needs to be made and then prepared for delivery, which includes bagging the food, including any utensils or condiments, and checking to make sure all of the components have been placed in the bag. The employee responsible for deliveries usually has several deliveries at once, so all of the bags and orders need to be placed in warming bags to keep hot foods hot, and then delivered to the customer who ordered.<br><br><b>Server Capabilities</b> - It’s vital for restaurants taking online orders to ensure they have the infrastructure in place to handle large volumes of online orders. A high-profile marketing campaign, as well as increased exposure, can lead to a large number of online orders being placed, which can tax a system not designed to handle such capacity. As a result, customers will be left with re-direct pages, timed-out messages, and blank web pages, and you’ll probably be getting phone calls that hint of frustration while trying to order.<br><br><b>Accessibility</b> - With such a sharp increase in the number of customers ordering from apps and smartphones, having an online ordering system that isn’t mobile-friendly could cause a problem in your overall sales. Monitor your analytics to see how customers are accessing your Web page and online ordering system.<br><br>

                                  <b>Food Ordering</b> is the profession of managing a restaurant. The management is mainly divided into <i>three broader section</i>.<br><br><b>Floor management:</b> 'Floor management' includes managing staff who give services to customers and allocate the duties of opening and closing restaurant. The manager is responsible for making sure his or her staff is following the <b>service standards and health and safety regulations</b>. The manager is the most important person in the front-of-the-house environment, since it is up to him or her to motivate the staff and give them job satisfaction. The manager also <b>looks after and guides the personal well-being of the staff, since it makes the work force stronger and more profitable.</b><br><br><b>Kitchen Management:</b> 'Kitchen Management' includes the <b> managing staff working in the kitchen, especially the head chef</b>. The kitchen is the most important part of the business and the main reason customers patronize the restaurant. Managing the kitchen staff helps to <b>control food quality</b>.<br><br>As most commercial kitchens are a closed environment, the staff may become bored or tired from the work. <b>Without proper management, this often results in an inconsistent food product.</b><br><br>Kitchen management involves most importantly, <b>cost control and budgeting.
